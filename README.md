# Efficiency Analysis of Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning
## Introduction
Machine Learning techniques have been used to analyze and predict stock prices of a given company. These systems are quite common nowadays. But how reliable are these predictions? It is a known fact that stock prices fluctuate on many factors like Economic factors, Company trends etc. In this project, we will evaluate the reliability of these predictions by training a model on a stock price dataset and then trying to predict  when the price fluctuated due to some Economic conditions. This will help us analyze the reliability of such systems when situation deviates from the normal situation.

## Approach
An ML Model is used to train on the historical data of the stock prices of a chosen stock price dataset (Nifty50). This is then used to predict the stock prices during a recent unstable economic condition (COVID-19 lockdown) to evaluate its reliability. 
The dataset used will be Nifty50 Stock Price dataset and the data is taken from January 2018 â€“ February 2020. Hence, we learn the data till the lockdown period and predict the prices during the lockdown period to evaluate how well it copes up with the unstable economic conditions compared to the trend in the previous years.

In this experiment, we will be evaluating the model prediction in both quantitative (absolute error) and qualitative way (From the perspective of an investor) to conclude its reliability.

## Execution of Projct
Run the <i>predict-stock-prices-with-lstm.ipynb</i> file in the code. The results will be displayed within the notebook itself.
